## What is OPCAIC?
OPCAIC is an online platform for conducting AI tournaments, opened for everybody to participate! There are two types of users of our platform: *organizers* and *competitors*. *Organizers* create tournaments through web interface, allowing them to choose the game, specify the rules, pick tournament format etc. After creating such a tournament, the *competitors* can submit their own bots to compete in it! Then, the tournament is evaluated automatically, and its detailed results are available in real time on our website. Yes, it's that simple!
## About us
OPCAIC was created in 2019 as a student final project of *Software project* course at MFF UK, Prague. It was intended to serve primarily as an automated tool for creating and evaluating tournaments conducted as a part of various courses held at our university, such as *Artificial Intelligence*. However, we decided to make the platform publicly available, so that anyone can take their part in.
## Source
The project is completely open-source, available on [github](https://github.com/opcaic). Since OPCAIC is mainly intended for university tournaments, public tournaments are not our primary goal. However,if you want to start your own version of the platform with your own tournaments or even games, you are encouraged to do so!
