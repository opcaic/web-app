## So, how should I start?
To take part in the tournaments, you have to create an account first, through the Register tab. After you have created an account, you can log in and then browse through publicly available tournaments, and submit your bots to them. 
## Where can I see available tournaments?
You can browse all available tournaments on Tournaments tab.
## Ok, but I can't see tournament X that is supposed to be there
Apart from public tournaments, there are also private tournaments available only to invited users. If you want to compete in such a tournament, you have to contact its organizer (likely your teacher), so that he can invite you.
## What programming languages can I write my bots in?
The language of submissions depends on the game of the tournament, and the detailed rules for submitting bots should be visible on Tournament's detail page, Overview tab.
## What is the API of the game X?
Again, game's API documentation should be available through the Tournament's detail page, Overview tab. 
## How can I submit a solution?
There is a Submit button on Tournament's detail page.
## How will whether my submission was correct?
The submission will be validated after uploading, and you can see the validation's result on the My submissions tab.
## Where can I find the tournament's results?
On the Tournament's detail page, there are tabs Leaderboards and Matches. The *Leaderboards* tab contains the final (for deadline) or actual (for ongoing) leaderboards of a tournament. *Matches* tab serves for detailed logs of the tournament's matches.
## Where can I find my results in a tournament?
There are also two more tabs on the Tournament's detail page. *My submissions* tab, you can view your submissions, see whether they are valid and active in the tournament. The last tab is called *My matches* and you can see filtered log of matches played by your submissions. 

## Nice, but how can I create my own tournament?
You have to become an organizer first, which is a role intended primarily for teachers at our university etc. If you really want to create/test your own tournaments, we advice you to fork the project, and do it locally. However, if you think you do have a good reason to become an organizer, you can also contact us.
## Which are the games available for tournaments?
Currently implemented games can be viewed on the Games tab.
## Can't you add game X?
Adding a new game to the platform requires us to implement it, so if you really need it, you have to contact us.
## What custom settings can I choose for a tournament?
You can create tournaments with most of the usual tournament formats/scopes/types, such as deadline/ongoing tournaments, single/double elimination, ELO, etc. To view the full list, see the Create tournament tab in the Organizer dashboard. 
## Who will be able to see/compete/manage the tournament?
Tournaments can be either public (so that anyone can see/compete in them) or private (so that only invited users can take part in). You can specify that when creating one. You can also add other users as tournament managers, so that they have the same rights to it as you.
